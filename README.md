Minimal VSCode Extension to scan the `.env` file properties from the root folder of the project and create/update workspace's `settings.json` on `maven.terminal.customEnv` configuration automatically with the expected format of `environmentVariable` & `value`, which will be prefixed with maven commands when executed from the vscode maven lifecycle.

In addition an entry to `launch.json` also will be made, pointing to the `.env` file under the specific workspace for Java projects to directly to prefix the properties on being executed with `main class`.

That's it, that's all it does. Just that I'm lazy enough to do them manually everytime, this comes in place ðŸ¤— !!
